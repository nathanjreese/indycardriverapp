He moves over to Meyer Shank Racing in 2024 where he'll be the lead veteran everywhere but Indy. Look for Felix to embrace that role and help bring MSR to the next level. Always a fast qualifier, Felix had 2 poles in 2024 but will need to turn those into better finishes if he is to move up the standings.",

Tom did come up through the European open wheel ladder and spent a couple of years in Formula E, so open wheel racing is nothing new to him. He will team up with Felix Rosenqvist and have Helio Castroneves as a mentor as he aims to win rookie of the year in 2024.",
